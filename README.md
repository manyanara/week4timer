# Week 4 Assignment: Timed Quiz

## Description

I wanted to tackle this assignment and focus on organizing my functions (which still needs a lot of work I am understanding), try to walk through the logic of buildling the timer and event listeners and figure out local storage. 

At the moment that I'm turning this in, the application is definetly buggy and I will be revisiting, but I did manage to learn lots of new nuances for javascript. 

## Installation

None needed simply follow the link: 

## Usage

To begin click "start" to launch the quiz and timer. Answer the questions to your best ability. The ending is buggy, I wanted to have users submit their name and then be shown all of their past scores with the quiz however I can't figure out why there are multiple prompts and I need to sort out more of the local storage displaying.

## Credits

While I did not copy any code I did have a great study team to help me and of course asked for help from my TA's and tutors at the UCB bootcamp.
